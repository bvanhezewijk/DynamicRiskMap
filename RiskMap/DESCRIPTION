Description: Functions for combining data for dynamic risk       mapping in R. Starts with functions for fetching data from a main    data library, formatting and importing raw data. Risk values are calculated for each data layer and combined into a single totalRisk layer. Static and interactive visualization functions of total risk, high risk and trapping grids are included. Risk mapping projects can be archived and reloaded later.
