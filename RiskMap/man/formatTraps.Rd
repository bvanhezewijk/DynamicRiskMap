}
\arguments{
\item{x}{List created by \code{projectList} function}

\item{dataLibraryPath}{File path to data library directory}

\item{outputFileName}{Name of file to be created; defaults to

}

\description{
Retrieves trap data from data library, reprojects to project CRS,
resolution and ROI. Adds unique trap IDs and moth counts. Saves raster 
and points in projectDir and adds to projectList.
}
\details{
Additional format functions for other trap data should follow this 
  function as a template. Named slots ("Catch", "Year", "trapID") should remain
  the same as they are called in other functions including \code{plotTraps}, \code{zoomTraps}
  and \code{createReport}
