\title{Select ROI and subROI from map}
\usage{
getROI(mapOutline = NULL, roi = NULL, roisub = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapOutline}{Map outline to be displayed; must be projected}

\item{roi}{Region of interest; extent object, a matrix or vector 
of four numbers}

\item{roisub}{Subregion of interest; extent object, a matrix or 
vector of four numbers}
}
\value{
List with ROI, ROIsub and projection
}
\description{
Displays map and prompts user to select region of interest (ROI)
and ROIsub interactively. This function is called from within 
\code{projectList} when arguments \code{ROI} or\code{ROIsub} is \code{NULL}.
}
\details{
A projected map or spatial object is needed for interactively 
selecting extents. Selecting ROI allows for zooming in multiple times 
until the desired extent is chosen. 

Values for ROI, ROIsub and projection are added to the projectList if
\code{getROI} is called from within \code{projectList}
}
