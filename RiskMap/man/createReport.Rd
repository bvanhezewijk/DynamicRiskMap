\title{Generate PDF report for positive trap catches}
\usage{
createReport(x, fileName, basemap = "roadmap", addCircles = TRUE,
  circleRadius = 1609)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{List created by \code{projectList} function}

\item{fileName}{Character string; name of PDF report file output}

\item{basemap}{Basemap type: \code{'satellite'}, \code{'roadmap'} (default), \code{'hybrid'},
or \code{'terrain'}}

\item{addCircles}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, circles plotted around positive traps (default)}

\item{circleRadius}{Numeric; radius in raster units of circle around 
positive traps. Default = 1609 m (1 mile)}
}
\value{
A PDF report saved to the projectDirectory
}
\description{
Creates a PDF with an overall region map showing all positive traps, and 
individual local maps for each positive trap.
}
\details{
\code{createReport} calls the \code{pdf} function which opens the
  file \code{fileName} and the PDF commands needed to plot the maps are sent 
  to that file. \code{pdf} argument \code{onefile} is set to code{TRUE} so all 
  maps are added to the same PDF report. 
  
  The output report includes a map of the entire ROI showing positive 
  trap locations and individual zoomed in maps for each positive trap.
  If positive traps are less than 3 km apart, they are included on the 
  same map.
